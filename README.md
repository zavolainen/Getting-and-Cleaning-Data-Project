# datasciencecoursera
Jani's coursework on JHU's Data Science Specialization.

This is a peer-graded Assignment for JHU Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. As a 
outcome of the project there is a tinydata.txt file. See more details from CodeBook.

This repo includes the script used to collect and analyse the data set, CodeBook, the outcome dataset 
and this readme file.

The script, run_analysis.R, behaves as the per instructions attached below.

"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
